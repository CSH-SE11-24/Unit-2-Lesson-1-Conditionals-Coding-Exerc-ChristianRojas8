// Exercise 1: Age Checker

  console.log("You are an adult");
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are not an adult.")
}



// Exercise 2: Simple Comparison
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and displays whether the first number is greater, less than, or equal to the second number.
// Note: make sure you have the correct types!
let number1 = prompt("Enter your first number")
let number2= prompt("Enter your second number");


if (number1 > number2) {
  console.log("Number 1 is greater than number 2")
} else if (number1 < number2) {
  console.log("Number 2 is greater than number 1")
} else if (number1 == number2){
  console.log("Both of your numbers are equal to each other" )
}


// Exercise 3: Even or Odd
// Create a program that asks the user for an integer and then prints whether the number is even or odd. (Google how to check this!)
let num = prompt("Enter an even or an odd number");
